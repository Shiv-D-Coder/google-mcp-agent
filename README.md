## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Guide

> Before running the project, set up your Google Cloud project for OAuth.

### üîë 1. Enable APIs in Google Cloud Console

2. Navigate to **"APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"**
3. Choose **"External"** > Fill in app name and support email
4. Under **Scopes**, you don't need to add anything manually now
5. Under **Test users**, add the **Gmail/Drive account** you want to access (must match the email you're using)

### üßæ 2. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials
1. Go to **"APIs & Services" > "Credentials"**
2. Click **"Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"**
3. Choose **"Desktop App"** or **"Web App"**
4. Download the **`client_creds.json`** file

## üîê Authentication Info (One-time Manual, Then Persistent)

- The **first time** you run the server, a **browser window will open** asking you to log in and authorize access.
- After successful login, a `token.json` file will be created automatically in your local directory.
- This file contains your OAuth access/refresh token and is reused for future runs.
- You won‚Äôt need to re-authenticate unless the token expires or is deleted.
   

> ‚ö†Ô∏è _No need to publish the app ‚Äî keeping it in testing mode is fine as long as the user is whitelisted._
